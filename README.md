# Stress Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting stress levels using machine learning techniques. It includes two Jupyter notebooks and two datasets.

## 📂 Files
- `stress.ipynb` - Main notebook for stress analysis.
- `spam.ipynb` - Supporting notebook (possibly for binary classification model or comparison).
- `stress.csv` - Dataset containing stress-related data.
- `spam.csv` - Additional dataset for training/testing.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `stress.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to see the results.

## 🛠️ Requirements
